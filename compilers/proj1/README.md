 -== Project 1 ==-

Name
====
	p1 [fileName]


Description
===========
	Lexically analyse a file and produce tokens


How To Use
==========
	To invoke the lexical analyser, use the command 'p1' and then give an argument for the file you want to analyse (refer to "Input Files Expected").


Purpose
=======
	This is an implementation of a finite state machine to recognize patterns using regular expressions to make tokens
	for the parser in project 2. It reads an input file from the command line and writes lexemes and tokens to the
	screen.


Input Files Expected
====================	
	Command line argument expects a file as the first argument ("p1 fileName")


Output Created
==============
	Output will be printed to the screen. Later, output will be printed to a file to be passed to project 2's parcer.
